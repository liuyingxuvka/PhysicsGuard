# Native Depth and Purpose

Load only for creating, materially deepening, revising or closing a task-local model. Ordinary bounded route execution does not load this reference.

### Strict task-local model deepening

The selected native route keeps its physical/evidence judgment. The shared task-local schema and evaluator bind its model, observations, revisions and current evidence.

For every non-trivial task, use the existing `task-model plan -> observe -> revision` route with the strict current schema. The plan must declare a non-empty task purpose, an independently owned coverage-universe id and SHA-256, explicit assumptions and unknowns (empty is allowed only when written explicitly), iteration, an exact predecessor receipt after iteration zero, and a current `physicsguard_task_native_depth_receipt` bound to the plan model. Retired optional fields and compatibility shapes are invalid.

The native depth receipt must account for exactly six families: execution depth, mapping, residual, uncertainty, diagnosability, and predictive rollout. Open gaps, resolution classes, external input ids, and next actions come from that target-owned receipt; AI prose, `resolved=true`, caller-written gap lists, and self-reported understanding have no closure authority.

Freeze the prediction before observation and bind the observation to the exact plan fingerprint, selected probe, producer, source, independence group, and evidence SHA-256. If the observation contradicts every declared hypothesis, return `model_miss` and revise the hypothesis/model universe; never select a physical cause by elimination outside the declared space.

A candidate revision must preserve distinct base/candidate identities and consume base/candidate native-depth receipts plus exactly one typed regression receipt, one independent holdout receipt, and one predictive-rollout receipt. All three must bind the same task, plan, revision, coverage fingerprint, and candidate SHA-256; the holdout must be independent from candidate construction. PhysicsGuard derives resolved, persisted, and introduced gaps by comparing the two native receipts. Renaming or deleting a caller gap is not progress.

`model_closed_for_task` is legal only when the candidate identity is current, every typed check passes, and the candidate native receipt has zero open gaps. Otherwise preserve the exact non-success boundary: `continue_iteration`, `external_input_required`, `progress_stalled`, `iteration_limit`, `scope_excluded`, or `model_miss`. A passing regression with any native gap is continuation, not closure.

Use `python -m physicsguard.guard_model_contract check-current-contract|check-current-candidate|prove-current|check-current-closure` with an explicit `--target-root` and explicit paths for `--contract`, `--candidate`, `--oracles`, `--known-good`, `--known-bad`, and `--proofs` as required. The verifier rejects implicit current directories and bundled baseline artifacts as current-model authority.
