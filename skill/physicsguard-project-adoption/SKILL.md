# PhysicsGuard Project Adoption

Use this route before non-trivial PhysicsGuard debugging or model-building work in a repository.

## Workflow

1. Run a read-only audit first:

   ```powershell
   python -m physicsguard.cli project audit --pretty
   ```

2. If the project is not adopted and the user authorized repository setup, run:

   ```powershell
   python -m physicsguard.cli project adopt --pretty
   ```

3. If the installed package version is newer than the record, run:

   ```powershell
   python -m physicsguard.cli project upgrade --pretty
   ```

4. Treat project adoption as workflow evidence only. It does not prove residual behavior, physical correctness, or localization.

## Claim Boundary

Safe claim: the project has a discoverable PhysicsGuard workflow record.

Unsafe claim: the model is physically correct, the fault is localized, or a commercial model has been reconstructed.
